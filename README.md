# Teaching Climate Science with Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to enhance the teaching and understanding of climate science. It includes models for **Climate Impact Assessment (ICIAF)** and **Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies (CAMS)**, allowing for predictive analysis of climate change impacts on Earth's environmental systems.

## ⚙️ Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Teaching-Climate-Science-Deep-Learning.git
cd Teaching-Climate-Science-Deep-Learning
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
### 🔹 Data Processing
Preprocess the raw climate dataset.
```sh
python src/data_processing.py
```
This will clean and transform the data, saving the processed version in `data/processed/`.

### 🔹 Train Model
Train a deep learning model using the preprocessed data.
```sh
python src/model_training.py
```
The trained model will be saved in `models/`.

### 🔹 Run Inference
Use the trained model to make predictions on new climate data.
```sh
python src/inference.py
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (Deep Learning)
- **Scikit-learn** (Data Processing & Modeling)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
